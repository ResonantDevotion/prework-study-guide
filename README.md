# Prework repo for the FEWD bootcamp

## Description

This was created for us student to learn how to build a basic website and add all of the essential elements, such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
As such, my motivation was to learn how to build a basic website in order to learn new skills and get a good job.
The problem this tasks aimed to solve was to provide a prework study guide to new students to help them learn and understand web development better.
I learnt a little about HTML, CSS and Javascript, how to git push, pull, merge, make repos and how to use the terminal.
